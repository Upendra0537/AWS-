
Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
Models
- Cloud Based Deployment
- On Premises Deployment - Private Cloud
- Hydrid Deployment

----------------------------
EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute  
----------------------------

EC2 instances
    |
Hypervisor
    |
AWS Host - Physical

- Compute As A Service (CaaS Model)
Multitenancy - Sharing Underlying Hardware between virtual Machines
hypervis0r - resposible to handle multitenancy on the AWS Host
instances can be vertically scalable
control
- underlying OS
- Softwares required
- Networking aspect

Instance Type
- General Resources - Application/gaming/small-medium DB
- Compute Optimized - HPC(High Performance Processess)
- Memory Optimized
- Accelerated Computing - floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching
- storage Optimize - OLTP

Instance Pricing
- On-Demand - baseline
- Savings Plans - Commitment - 1 or 3 year - 72% saving
- Reserved Instances - 75% saving (1 or 3 years) - upfront/partial/noupfront
- Spot Instances - 90% savings - reclaim(2 min warning) - batch workload
- Dedicated hosts - physical hosts- complaince requirement

Scalability and Elasticity of EC2
Auto Scaling
- Dynamic scaling - to changing demand. 
- Predictive scaling - automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
- Contains min/desired/max
Elastic load balancer - ELB
- takes request and shares it appropriately to the Instances
- Regional constraint
- auto scalable
- scale out - increase instances
- sclae in - decrease instance(wait for the existing work to close)

Messaging and Queuing
- moving away from tightly coupled architecture - monolithic application. 
- loosely couples - on component failed other applications can still continue - microservices approach
- Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) - Send, store, recieve - Payload(data) - host the queues
- Amazon Simple Notificaiton Service (SNS) - Pub Sub model - Create Topic and subscribers 

Server Less Compute options
- AWS Lambda - upload the function and config the trigger - less than 15 mins - no managing server
- Need more information on environment - Container Orchestration tool  - Run docker container based workload
	- AWS Elastic Container Services - ECS
	- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Services - EKS
- AWS Fargate - on top of ECS and EKS - managed by AWS (EC2 we need to manage)
